      <p>
        I build, I optimize, I scale. Whether it's a high-throughput crypto exchange, an AI-driven analytics
        engine, or a decentralized gaming ecosystem, I thrive on architecting systems that push boundaries. My
        expertise spans full-stack development, machine learning, and distributed systems, with a knack for
        turning complex ideas into rock-solid, scalable solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In crypto, I've led engineering teams that built and scaled DeFi platforms handling billions in trading
        volume, developed NFT marketplaces connecting digital and physical assets, and designed high-performance
        L1/L2 integrations. In AI, I've developed explainability tools for neural networks, designed, trained,
        and deployed custom models, and I have deep experience turning POCs or research into production-ready
        inference pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive in <strong>high-impact</strong> roles where I can lead teams, refine architecture, and drive technical
        vision. If you're looking for someone who can navigate blockchain, AI, and large-scale
        infrastructure, let's connect.
